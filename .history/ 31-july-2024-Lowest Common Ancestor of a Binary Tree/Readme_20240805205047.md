# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

## Description

This project implements a function to find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary tree. The LCA of two nodes `p` and `q` in a binary tree is defined as the deepest node that has both `p` and `q` as descendants.


## aproach 

I clearly find this way too much difficult to understand and easy to implement , here what are we basically doing ? finding one of the node , and given in the question , there definately exisit both the nodes in the tree , so what i did is,

Step1 : I called basic search method from root to search both the values.
Step2  : if i  find both in my left and right , then  i would receive the nodes as my left and right values( as a return value from my left and right calss) , then root is my lca . 

Step 3 ; If i recived one of the node is null , then it means, the two nodes are in the sane side ( either left or right)  , this basically means we find one of the node and got that value back ,and we also know the other node is on the same side , so obviously this current node would be the lca, as the other node is still depp below this node.


## TreeNode Definition

The `TreeNode` class is used to represent nodes in the binary tree. Each node has an integer value, a left child, and a right child.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
