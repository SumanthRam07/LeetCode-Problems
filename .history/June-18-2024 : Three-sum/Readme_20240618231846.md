Three Sum Problem


Problem Description : 
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0 and note that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example 
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
Explanation:
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1, -1, 2] and [-1, 0, 1].



My Solution : 

   1) My basic idea before solving this problem is , dividing the given problem into a  two sum , and assuming the current traversing index as my target 
   2) This makes this problem as known problem 

The approach i  used is first sorting the array and the two-pointer technique to find all unique triplets that sum up to zero and collect the values into a list 

Steps:

Step 1 ) Sort the array.

step 2) Iterate through each number, treating it as the first number of the triplet.

Step 3) Use two pointers to find the other two numbers of the triplet such that their sum is equal to the negative of the first number.
         Skip duplicate elements to ensure all triplets are unique.

Complexity Analysis
  Time Complexity
     Sorting the array takes O(n log n).
      The main loop runs in O(n), and for each element, the two-pointer technique takes O(n) in the worst case.
      Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

   Space Complexity
      The space complexity is O(1) if we disregard the space used for the output list.
      The output list itself can take up to O(n^2) space in the worst case, but this is output space.
