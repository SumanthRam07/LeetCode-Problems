## validateStackSequences
The validateStackSequences method checks if a given sequence of stack operations (push and pop) can result in a particular sequence of popped elements. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to verify the validity of stack operations in algorithms and data structures.

## Introduction
The validateStackSequences method is implemented within the Solution class. It uses a single stack to simulate the push and pop operations and verifies if the sequence of popped elements is valid based on the given sequence of pushed elements.

### Usage and thought process
Initialization
To use the validateStackSequences method, first create an instance of the Solution class

#### Idea : Basically the question states that will that be scenarios be possible, not just simaltaniously , but at any point in pushing sequence.
       To solve this , i did paralled comparision , i have checked the top value with the first value that can be popped and continue the pop function if the sequence matches, in this way we are checking for every possible  use case

 

java

```java
Solution solution = new Solution();
Validation Method
To validate the stack sequences, call the validateStackSequences method with two integer arrays representing the pushed and popped sequences:
```

java

```java
int[] pushed = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int[] popped = {4, 5, 3, 2, 1};
boolean isValid = solution.validateStackSequences(pushed, popped);
```

#### Example
Here is an example of how to use the validateStackSequences method:

j
```java

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        int[] pushed = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] popped = {4, 5, 3, 2, 1};
        
        boolean isValid = solution.validateStackSequences(pushed, popped);
        System.out.println(isValid); // Output: true

        int[] pushed2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] popped2 = {4, 3, 5, 1, 2};
        
        boolean isValid2 = solution.validateStackSequences(pushed2, popped2);
        System.out.println(isValid2); // Output: false
    }
}
```
#### Explanation

##### The validateStackSequences method works as follows:

Step 1 :Initialize an empty stack (pushStack) and a pointer (j) to track the position in the popped array.
Step 2 :Iterate through each element in the pushed array:
Step 3 :Push the current element onto the stack.
Step4  :While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack equals the current element in the popped array, pop the element from the stack and move the Step5  :pointer j to the next element in the popped array.
Step6  :After processing all elements, if the stack is empty, the sequence of popped elements is valid; otherwise, it is not.
