**Overview**
The deleteMiddle method in the Solution class is basically  designed to remove the middle node from a singly linked list . The algorithm ensures the middle node is removed in a single pass, maintaining optimal time complexity.git a

**Approach**
**Steps**

Step 1 :  Count the Nodes: 
     Traverse the list to count the total number of nodes.
step2  : 
      Identify the Middle: Calculate the middle position.
step 3 " 

       Remove the Middle Node: Traverse again to the node just before the middle node and adjust pointers to remove the middle node.


**Complexity**
Time Complexity: o(n)

O(n) : The list is traversed twice.
Space Complexity:  O(1) - No additional space is used.
