# Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is symmetric around its center.

# Understand
Input: The root node of a binary tree.
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the tree is symmetric.
Symmetric Tree: A tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.
Match
Match this problem with common data structure operations. In this case, the problem involves binary tree traversal and comparison.

Tree Traversal: We need to visit each node to compare the subtrees.
Recursive Solution: Using recursion, we can easily traverse and compare the subtrees to check for symmetry.
Plan
Base Case: If both subtrees are null, they are symmetric.
Single Null Check: If only one of the subtrees is null, they are not symmetric.
Value Check: Check if the values of the current nodes are equal.
Recursive Comparison: Recursively compare the left subtree of the first tree with the right subtree of the second tree and vice versa.



# Review
## Test Cases:

Empty Tree:       The input is null. The output should be true.
Single Node       Tree: The tree has only one node. The output should be true.
Symmetric Tree:   Ensure that symmetric trees return true.
Asymmetric Tree:  Ensure that asymmetric trees return false.
Time Complexity:  The function visits each node once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
Space Complexity:  The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
