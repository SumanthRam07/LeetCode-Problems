# Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

This repository contains a Java solution to the problem of finding the minimum depth of a binary tree. The solution is implemented using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach.

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

## Solution Explanation

The code provides a BFS solution to calculate the minimum depth of a binary tree. The BFS approach is suitable for this problem because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

### Code Structure

The solution is implemented in the `Solution` class with a single main method:

#### `minDepth(TreeNode root)`

This method calculates the minimum depth of a binary tree using a BFS approach.

It follows these steps:
- If the root is `null`, return 0 (base case for an empty tree).
- If the root is a leaf node (both left and right children are `null`), return 1.
- Use a queue to perform BFS, starting with the root node.
- Initialize a counter `count` to track the depth level.
- While the queue is not empty:
  - Get the number of nodes at the current depth level.
  - For each node at the current depth level:
    - Remove the node from the queue.
    - If the node is a leaf node, return the current depth level `count`.
    - Add the left and right children of the node to the queue if they are not `null`.
  - Increment the depth level `count`.
- If the loop ends without finding a leaf node, return -1 (this case should not occur for a valid binary tree).

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        int count = 1; 
        if (root == null) return 0;
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) return 1;
        
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>(); 
        queue.add(root); 
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode temp = queue.remove(); 
                if (temp.left == null && temp.right == null) return count;
                if (temp.left != null) queue.add(temp.left);
                if (temp.right != null) queue.add(temp.right);
            }
            count++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
